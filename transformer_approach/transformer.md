You are absolutely correct. While the `nn.Transformer` module in PyTorch is a powerful tool for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, it fundamentally relies on **parallel data** for training. Let's break down why:

**Why nn.Transformer Needs Parallel Data:**

* **Supervised Learning:** The `nn.Transformer` operates on a supervised learning paradigm. It learns to map input sequences (source language) to output sequences (target language) by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the ground truth provided in the parallel data.
* **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** The Transformer's encoder-decoder structure is designed to process aligned sentence pairs. The encoder learns representations of the source sentence, and the decoder uses these representations to generate the target sentence. Without parallel sentences, the model lacks the crucial signal for aligning and learning the mapping between languages.

**Cycle Loss and Monolingual Corpora:**

Cycle loss, on the other hand, is a technique specifically designed for **unsupervised** or **weakly supervised** machine translation. It enables training translation models using only monolingual corpora. The core idea is to enforce a cycle consistency constraint:

1. **Forward Translation:** Translate a sentence from source language A to target language B.
2. **Backward Translation:** Translate the resulting sentence back from language B to language A.
3. **Cycle Consistency Loss:** Minimize the difference between the original sentence in language A and the reconstructed sentence after the forward and backward translations.

**Why nn.Transformer Isn't Suitable for Cycle Loss with Monolingual Data:**

* **Lack of Alignment Information:**  `nn.Transformer` expects aligned sentence pairs as input. With only monolingual data, there's no initial alignment information to guide the training process.
* **Training Objective Mismatch:** The standard training objective of `nn.Transformer` (e.g., cross-entropy loss) is not directly compatible with the cycle consistency constraint used in unsupervised settings.

**Alternative Architectures for Cycle Loss:**

To use cycle loss with monolingual corpora, you would typically employ architectures and training procedures specifically designed for this purpose. Some examples include:

* **CycleGAN:** A popular model that uses two generators (for forward and backward translation) and two discriminators (to distinguish between real and translated sentences).
* **Dual Learning:** A similar approach that leverages the duality of the translation task (A to B and B to A).

**In summary, you are right that `nn.Transformer` is not the appropriate choice for building a translator using only monolingual corpora and cycle loss. You would need to explore architectures like CycleGAN or Dual Learning that are explicitly designed for unsupervised or weakly supervised machine translation scenarios.**
